# Sara Rose Wendland - Portfolio	

## Description

The goal of this application is to create a portfolio that will have:

- A section with information about me, including a picture or avatar. 
- A portfolio of work that will showcase my strongest work and the processes behind it to present my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time       position. 
- A section with my contact information and links to each. 
- A navigation section that the UI scrolls to the corresponding section of. 
- A section with titled images of my applications that the link to the sectionin the navigation bar causes the UI to scroll to.  
- When first application is hovered over that application's image will appear larger in size than the others, and when the image for the application is clicked, the user is taken to that deployed application. Placeholders are used for future applications. They will be coded to open in new tabs. 
- The design will adapts to user's viewport when resizing the page or viewing the site on various screens and devices.
